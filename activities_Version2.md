**Instructions:**  
To make the links work for your students:
1. Upload the actual HTML files (`swiss-cheese-builder.html` and `quality_dimensions_explorer.html`) to your repository (`AwaisMashkoor/QIHS`).
2. Once uploaded, I will update this Markdown file with the correct links so students can click to access or download the activities directly from GitHub.
